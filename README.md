# Stable Horde Bridge

This repo contains the latest implementation for the [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net) Bridge. This will turn your graphics card(s) into a worker for the Stable Horde and you will receive in turn kudos which will give you priority for your own generations.

To run the bridge, simply run:

Windows: `horde-bridge.cmd`
Linux: `horde-bridge.sh`

This will take care of the setup for this environment and then automatically start the bridge.
